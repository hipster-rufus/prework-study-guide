# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created for bootcamp students who were going through prework and gearing up to take the DU Coding Bootcamp for the next six months. It contains a list of basic notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The study guide was also created to teach myself the basic functions of all those languages as it was being created.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. I suggest you inspect the page and access the Chrome DevTools (press Command+Option+I for macOS, or Control+Shift+I for Windows), and then open the console panel tab at the top. Underneath the console is a list of topics featured in the prework along with a suggestion on which topics to study first.
