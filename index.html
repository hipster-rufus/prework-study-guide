          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Child elements are nested inside parent elements.</li>
          <li>Semantic elements describe their content and function to the developers and browser.</li>
          <li>The difference between an element and a tag is, an element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, while a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Section elements define a section in a document that contains thematic content, such as this one.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>In a CSS rule, a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, a declaration contains two important components: the property we want to apply, and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>External style sheets are the preferred way to style a webpage due to the CSS file remaining separate from the HTML file, allowing for easier design changes.</li>
          <li>The other two types of CSS style sheets are inline and internal.</li>
        </ul>
